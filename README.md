# Automaton: 8-Divisor-Binary

An automaton that checks if any entered input is a valid word. For this
automaton, a valid word is the binary representation of any natural number that
can be divided by the binary representation of eight, without leaving a
remainder. Any input must be bigger than the natural number 0.

The following state diagram represents the automaton.
